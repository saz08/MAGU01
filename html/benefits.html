<h2>Available benefits</h2>
<p>All the information shown is from <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/practically/financial-support/government-benefits/available-benefits">Cancer Research UK</a></p>
<p>Many benefits are available, including help for people in hospital, on a low income, disabled, over pension age, or parents and carers.</p>

<p>Here's a guide to what's available, depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h2>Specific benefits and allowances</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
Universal Credit(UC)
    </li>

<h2>For hospital inpatients</h2>
<p>Any Attendance Allowance or Disability Living Allowance payments you might get will carry on if you’re in hospital for less than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>For longer hospital stays</p>
<p>the benefits will stop – but they’ll start again when you go home.</p>

<p>When these benefits stop, it may affect other benefits you get. If you get Income Support severe disability premium, or if the person that looks after you receives Carer's Allowance, these will change when your DLA or AA stop.</p>

<p>When the government works out your benefits, it links your hospital stays together if they’re less than 4 weeks apart. For example, if you’ve been in hospital for 4 weeks (so your benefits have stopped), the benefits will start again when you go home. But if you then go back into hospital within another 4 weeks, your benefits will stop straight away.</p>

<p>Housing Benefit and the housing costs included in Income Support or Pension Credit all stop after you have spent a year in hospital.</p>

<h2>For same sex couples</h2>
<p>The benefits rules treat same sex couples in the same way as opposite sex couples. So you must claim jointly for welfare benefits, Housing Benefit and Tax Credits.</p>

<p>You might find that you’re worse off, because your partner's income is taken into account. If you haven't told the benefits authorities that you’re in a same sex couple, they may take back any money they think they have overpaid you.</p>

<h2>Help with prescription costs</h2>
<p>Each UK country has separate guidance about health charges.</p>

<p>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not have prescription charges.</p>

<p>Cancer patients in England don’t have to pay prescription charges for any medicines. This applies to people who are having treatment for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
cancer
    </li>
    <li>
the effects of cancer
    </li>
    <li>
the effects of current or past cancer treatment
    </li>
    </ul>
<p>To get free prescriptions, you apply for a 5 year prescription exemption certificate using form FP92A. You can get this from your GP or cancer clinic. You and your GP or cancer specialist need to sign it. You can renew the exemption certificate as many times as you need. But it is up to you to renew it – you may not get a reminder.</p>
