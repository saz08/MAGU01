<p>Pain may be an unavoidable part of your lung cancer, but there are many strategies to help lessen the discomfort.</p>

<p>For people experiencing significant pain from either their lung cancer itself or the side effects of lung cancer treatment, pain management is a very important part of the overall treatment plan.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are many options available to you, from medication to alternative therapies.</p>

<b>The Sources of Pain</b>
<p>People with lung cancer may experience different types of pain including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pain caused by the cancer itself. This may be because a tumor in your lungs is pressing on nerves in your spine, resulting in chest or back pain.</li>
    <li>Pain caused by cancer that has spread to other places in the body. If your cancer has spread to your bones, you probably will experience bone pain. Cancer that has spread to the liver may cause pain in your abdomen. And cancer that spreads to the brain can result in headaches.</li>
    <li>Pain due to your lung cancer treatment. After surgery, you'll likely experience pain and soreness that will last a few days or weeks as you recover. Chemotherapy (drug therapy) for lung cancer may cause pain as well. Some chemotherapy drugs can cause nerve damage, leading to pain or burning or tingling sensations, mainly in the hands or feet.</li>
    <li>Pain caused by paraneoplastic syndromes. These rare syndromes are caused by an immune response to a cancer. Instead of attacking only the cancer cells, the immune system attacks normal cells as well, potentially causing a broad range of symptoms, sometimes including pain.</li>
</ul>

<b>Pain Management</b>
<p>How your pain is treated will largely depend on the extent and cause. Pain management strategies may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Medications.</b> Some lung cancer-related pain can be managed with over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). In cases of more severe pain, opioids such as codeine or morphine may be prescribed.  For certain types of pain, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications may be helpful.</li>
    <li><b>Radiation.</b> For pain that is caused by lung cancer or by the spread of cancer to other parts of the body, radiation therapy can be used palliatively, to shrink tumors and help reduce discomfort.</li>
    <li><b>Surgery.</b> In some cases, surgery to remove part or all of a tumor can be used to relieve pain. Surgery can also be used to cut nerves and relieve pain.</li>
    <li><b>Nerve blocks.</b> Medications that target nerves can be given by injection to control pain.</li>
    <li><b>Alternative strategies.</b> Relaxation therapy, biofeedback, guided imagery, hypnosis, nerve stimulation, acupuncture, exercise, physical therapy, and counseling have all been shown to help manage pain that is related to cancer. While many of these approaches involve a health practitioner, you can do some of them, like relaxation therapy and guided imagery, at home and on your own.</li>

</ul>
<p>Pain has an enormous effect on your quality of life, so if you are experiencing pain related to your lung cancer, alert your medical team.</p>
