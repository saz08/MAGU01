<h2>Apply for or renew a Blue Badge in Scotland</h2>
    <p>The Blue Badge scheme supports people who cannot easily get around by helping them park closer to their destination. Blue Badges are also known as disabled parking permits.</p>

    <p>A Blue Badge should not be used unless the badge holder is getting in or out of the vehicle at the place it is parked.</p>
    <h2>Apply or renew online</h2>
    <p>You can apply for, or renew your Blue Badge online.</p>

<p>A few weeks before the expiry date printed on your Blue Badge you should decide if you still need its help to get around. If you do, you should apply for a new Blue Badge.</p>

<p>You may be required to attend a mobility assessment or provide up-to-date evidence of your eligibility.</p>

<p>All online applications will be sent to your local council who are responsible for the Blue Badge scheme in your area.</p>

<p>Councils have the option to charge up to Â£20 for the issue of a badge. You should ask your local council if there's a charge before you make an application.</p>

    <b>What you'll need to apply or renew online:</b>
    <ul>

<p>If you apply or renew online, you'll be asked a few eligibility questions.</p>

<h2>Apply or renew online</h2>

<b>When you cannot apply online</b>
<p>If you are not able to apply online, or prefer to apply in writing, you should contact your local council for an application form.</p>

<p>You cannot use the online form if you're applying for:</p>
<ul><li>a visually impaired child or young person under 16
</li>
    <li>
        someone who meets the risk in traffic criteria
    </li>
<li>Visit your local council's website for more information on Blue Badge applications.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How long does a Blue Badge last?</h2>
<p>A Blue Badge normally lasts for 3 years but a badge will be issued for less than 3 years if you get one because:</p>
<ul><li>your social security benefit award is for less than 3 years
</li>
    <li>
        you have a temporary but substantial disability lasting between 12 months and three years
    </li>
    <li>
        you made a successful application under the risk in traffic criteria
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Transferring your badge
</h2>
<p>If you need to transfer a Blue Badge from another part of the UK to Scotland, it's the responsibility of the council that issued your badge to change the address details and inform the new council. You can let your council know about these changes using an online form.</p>
