<h2>After Surgery</h2>
<p>The following information is from <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/lung-cancer/treatment/surgery/after-surgery">Cancer Research UK</a></p>

<b>Eating and drinking</b>
<p>Immediately after surgery you can’t eat or drink. You have fluids through a drip. When you can start to drink again, you begin with sips of water. This is usually within 24 to 48 hours.</p>

<p>You gradually build up what you drink and eat.</p>

<b>Getting up</b>
<p>Your nurses and physiotherapists help you to move around as soon as possible. They check you’re doing your breathing and leg exercises. This helps you recover.</p>

<p>You might be sitting in a chair within 12 hours of your operation. The day after, you’ll be walking around your bed. And within a few days you’ll be able to walk along the hospital corridor.</p>

<b>Making progress</b>
<p>During the first few days after your operation you’ll start to feel better. The drips and drains come out, you start eating, and you can move about better.</p>

<p>You’ll begin to feel that you’re making progress. After keyhole surgery you might go home 2 or 3 days after the operation. After open surgery most people go home about 5 to 10 days afterwards.</p>

<b>Going home</b>
<p>You’ll need help when you first go home.</p>

<p>You’re likely to feel very tired for several weeks and sometimes months after your surgery. It helps to do a bit more every day.</p>

<p>Try:</p>
<ul>
    <li>sitting for less time each day
    </li>
    <li>walking around the house a bit more each day
    </li>
    <li>building up to walking outside
    </li>
</ul>

<p>What you can do depends on how fit you were before your surgery and any problems you have afterwards. Talk to the physiotherapist or your doctor if you’re unsure about what you should be doing.</p>

<p>Contact your doctor or specialist nurse if you have any problems or symptoms you are unsure about.</p>

<b>Driving</b>
<p>After surgery to your chest you shouldn’t drive until the effects of the anaesthetic and painkillers have worn off. Your wounds must have healed well. At first the seat belt may press on your wound and make it sore.</p>

<p>Your doctor will tell you when you can start driving again but it is usually about 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. It might be sooner than this after keyhole surgery. Some insurance companies also specify that you shouldn’t drive for a certain amount of time after chest surgery. So it is important to check with your car insurance company.</p>

<b>Follow up</b>
<p>You have a follow up appointment about 2 to 6 weeks after your surgery.</p>

<p>At the follow up appointment your surgeon:</p>
<ul>
    <li>gives you the results of the surgery
    </li>
    <li>examines you
    </li>
    <li>asks you how you are and if you have had any problems
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The appointment is also your chance to ask the doctor questions. Write down any questions you have before your appointment to help you remember what you want to ask. Taking someone with you can help you to remember what the doctor says.</p>

<p>How often you have checkups after that depends on the results of your surgery. Ask your doctor or specialist nurse how often you need to have checkups and what they will involve.</p>

<p>If you are worried about anything or notice any new symptoms between appointments, let your doctor or nurse know as soon as possible. You don’t have to wait until the next appointment.</p>
