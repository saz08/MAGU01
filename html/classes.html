<h2>Move More Scotland</h2>
<p>The following information is from <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/about-us/health-professionals/programmes-and-services/move-more-scotland.html">Macmillan</a></p>
<p>Move More Scotland is part of Macmillan Cancer Support’s national campaign to ensure that people living with cancer are supported to become physically active, both before, during and after their treatment.</p>

<p>A growing body of evidence shows that being active can play a vital role in helping to prevent a recurrence of cancer. It can also slow disease progression as well as reducing the side effects and consequences of cancer treatment, such as fatigue.</p>

<p>Working in partnership with local authorities, Macmillan Cancer Support is delivering the Move More programme throughout Scotland, with more projects due to be rolled out in the near future.</p>

<p>The individually-tailored programme of physical activity support is designed to help people with cancer to become, and stay, active at a level that’s right for them. That could mean gardening, joining a walking group or taking part in Gentle Movement classes or more traditional supervised gym-based programmes. Move More is about providing opportunities for people to get moving in an enjoyable way that suits their lifestyle.</p>

<p>There are currently four programmes to choose from, all of which have been designed specifically for people affected by cancer:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Gentle Movement
        Takes you through a range of exercises which incorporate breathing techniques and mindfulness, led by qualified volunteers. The exercises are designed to get you moving but also provide you with an opportunity to relax. All the exercises can be done seated or standing.
    </li>
<li>
    Walking groups
    Led by a trained volunteer, these groups are low level, short, sociable walks which can be adapted to suit the participants.
</li>
<li>Circuits-based exercise classes
    These classes are delivered by fitness instructors with specialist cancer and exercise training. All classes are supported by volunteers.
</li>
    <li>Gardening groups
        These are led by volunteers and provide participants with the opportunity to get active through gardening. Activities can include developing floral and sensory garden displays or growing your own fruit and vegetables to harvest and take home to enjoy. Raised beds are utilised for ease of access and green fingers are not required.
