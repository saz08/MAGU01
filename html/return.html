<h2>Macmillan: Going back to work</h2>
<p>The following information is from <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/organising/work-and-cancer/information-for-employees/going-back-to-work.html">Macmillan</a></p>
<p>After your cancer treatment is over, you may have a number of different feelings. When you are ready to think about going back to work, talking to your employer can help. Deciding on a flexible return-to-work-plan can help both of you to understand:
<ul><li>how your employer can help you</li>
    <li>what you are capable of</li>
    <li>when changes might be needed.</li></ul>

<p>The plan might include changes to your hours, your duties, or your workplace. Depending on your condition, you may have to change parts of your job, for example driving or operating machinery. Your employer must make reasonable adjustments to help you return. This could include changing the requirements of your role, making sure you have suitable access to the workplace, or providing you with different tools.</p>

<p>It is also important to consider your financial situation. Your mortgage or credit agreements may have changed during your treatment. And if you were receiving benefits, returning to work may cause some of them to stop. There are many places to go for advice and guidance about financial issues. Call the Macmillan Support Line on 0808 808 00 00 to talk to one of our financial guides.</p>

<p>Macmillan offers a guide on your rights at work <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/organising/work-and-cancer/information-for-employees/your-rights.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtbnjBRDBARIsAO3zDl9ejVCOymLuAfKHRfCfM7MXTtt7zIMVA3AnB20MSAFqmnKqidSZ-UQaAl7PEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">here</a></p>
<p>If you have or have had cancer, you are protected by law from unfair treatment at work. This means that it's unlawful for an employer to treat you less favorably (discriminate against you) because of your cancer.</p>

   <p> Under equalities law your employer should try to support you. This includes making changes (known as reasonable adjustments) to help you stay in or return to work when you are ready and able to. </p>
