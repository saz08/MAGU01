<h2>Macmillan Grants</h2>
<p>The following information is from <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/organising/benefits-and-financial-support/benefits-and-your-rights/macmillan-grants.html">Macmillan.org.uk</a></p>


<p>Macmillan Grants are small payments to help people with the extra costs that cancer can cause. They are usually a one-off payment. They are for people who have a low level of income and savings.</p>

<p>If you need things like extra clothing, help paying heating bills or even a relaxing break, you may be able to get a Macmillan Grant.</p>

<p>How much you get will depend on your situation and needs. The average grant is around £400. A grant from Macmillan would not normally affect the benefits you are entitled to. It is an extra bit of help, not a replacement for other support.</p>


<b>Who can apply?</b>
<p>You can apply for a Macmillan Grant if you have cancer, or are still seriously affected by your illness or treatment. Both of the following must also apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have less than £6,000 in savings if you are single, or less than £8,000 as a couple or family.</li>
    <li>You have a low total income after you have paid rent, mortgage and council tax. We allow a weekly income of £170 for a single person, £289 for a couple or household of two people, £85 for each child, and £119 for each additional adult.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not count Personal Independence Payment (PIP), Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance (AA) in our calculations.</p>

<p>These are the general rules, but we do consider individual situations. Please contact us if you have any questions.</p>

<b>How to apply</b>
<p>We aim to make our application process as simple and quick as possible.
<ol>
    <li>You apply through a health or social care professional. This may be a social worker, a district nurse, a Macmillan benefits adviser, or a Macmillan nurse, if you have one.</li>
    <li>They fill in a grant application form with you and send it to the Grants team at Macmillan. They also include a short medical report from your specialist nurse, doctor or consultant.</li>
    <li>The Macmillan Grants team processes your application on the day they get it.</li>
    <li>If your application is approved, payments are usually sent out within 3 working days.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any personal or medical information included in your application will be treated confidentially.</p>
