<h2>Working and being a carer</h2>
<p>The following information is from <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/organising/work-and-cancer/if-youre-a-carer#162557">MacMillan</a></p>


<p>Not everyone thinks of themselves as a carer. But recognising that you are a carer is important in getting the practical, emotional and financial support you need. If you carry on working, you may also need support in the workplace. In any workplace around the UK, about 1 in 9 people are working while caring.</p>

<p>Balancing work and caring can be demanding. But carrying on working can also be positive. You can have a carer’s assessment to find out what kind of support you can get. You may also be entitled to financial help, such as benefits or grants. Try to talk to your manager about your situation as soon as possible. They can tell you about the support available in your workplace.</p>

<p>It is important to know what might happen when the person you care for is having tests or treatment. This may help you to understand some of the possible effects on your working life. We have information about different types of cancer and their treatments.</p>

<p>Some people may need help with their transport. Some GP surgeries and local voluntary groups can arrange volunteer drivers, and the hospital may also be able to help.</p>

<h2>Your rights at work as a carer</h2>
<p>If you have worked for your employer for at least 26 weeks, you are entitled to request flexible working. This may enable you to work from home or organise new working hours, for example. Flexible working arrangements can help you find a balance between work and caring responsibilities. If your employer refuses your request, you may be able to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>The law also protects a carer’s right to take unpaid time off to look after someone in an emergency.</p>

<p>Legislation protects people who experience discrimination because they are linked or associated with a disabled person (cancer is classed as a disability). For example, it would be unlawful if a carer was refused promotion because of concerns that they would be unable to give sufficient attention to the job. Under the law, carers are also protected against harassment and victimisation.</p>

<p>The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) can provide advice on your employment rights. In Northern Ireland you could contact the Labour Relations Agency.</p>

<h2>Work if you are a young carer</h2>

<p>If you are working, even if it is just part-time, you might decide to tell your manager or someone else at work that you are looking after someone with cancer.</p>

<p>Here are some reasons why you may want to tell someone at work about your situation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you get upset at work, they will be able to support you better.</li>
    <li>They will understand if you have to miss work or are late.</li>
    <li>They may be able to give you time off, or arrange for you to work flexible hours.</li>
    <li>If you work shifts, they could arrange your shifts to fit around your responsibilities at home.</li>
    <li>Depending on what job you do, you may be able to do some work at home.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be worried about telling your work, in case they think you can’t do your job properly. You may think that you will lose your job if you tell your boss that you are a young carer. In the UK, if you are the main carer for someone who has cancer, it is against the law for anyone to treat you badly at work because of your circumstances.</p>

<p>Of course, you may choose not to tell anyone at work that you are a young carer. You might want to go to work and just be normal. For some people, having a part-time job is a good chance to get out of the house and do something for themselves. It means having a place where you don’t have to think or talk about cancer.</p>

<p>Carers Trust has produced a free guide called Getting into work: a guide for young adult carers in England. It includes advice on how to deal with problems finding and staying in employment, how to find a job, how to apply for jobs, and how to speak to your employer about being a carer.</p>

    <b>Time off work</b>
<p>If you are the main carer for someone who has cancer, you could get paid or unpaid leave from work to look after them. You can find out more at <a href="https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/organising/work-and-cancer/if-youre-a-carer#162557">macmillan.org.uk/carersatwork</a>.</p>

<p>You can also call the Macmillan Support Line on 0808 808 00 00 to speak to a cancer support specialist. They will be able to talk you through what time off you are entitled to at work.</p>

<h2>Working when you are no longer a carer</h2>
<p>You may no longer be a carer because the person you were caring for has recovered, or is in hospital or a care home. Or the person you cared for may have died. It is common to have many different feelings about this, and coping with bereavement is a slow process.</p>

<p>If you have been bereaved, try to keep your manager informed about how you are feeling and about any time off work you might need, including funeral arrangements. Your employer may provide compassionate leave. How much time off work you need will vary for each person. Your employer may have an employee assistance programme (EAP) that can offer emotional support and counselling.</p>

<p>If your caring role has changed or ended, you may want to go back to your previous work pattern. If you have been off work for a while, it may be helpful to have a gradual, flexible return. Going back to full-time work may take time to get used to. Talk to your manager if you need training or support to help you.</p>

<p>If you gave up work and are looking to get a new job, there is lots of advice available. Your local Jobcentre or Jobs and Benefits Office should offer you job search support. There are also websites that give career advice.</p>
