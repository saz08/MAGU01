<h2>PET-CT scan</h2>
<p>Many people can experience anxiety when waiting for PET-CT scan results.</p>
<p>The following information is from <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/lung-cancer/getting-diagnosed/tests-stage/pet-ct-scan">Cancer Research UK</a></p>
<p>Find out about how you have a PET-CT scan to find the size of a lung cancer and whether it has spread.</p>

<b>What it is</b>
<p>A PET-CT scan combines a CT scan and a PET scan. It gives detailed information about your cancer. The CT scan takes a series of x-rays from all around your body. The PET scan uses a mildly radioactive drug to show up areas of your body where cells are more active than normal.</p>

    <b>How you have it</b>
<p>You usually have a PET-CT scan in the x-ray (radiology) department as an outpatient.</p>

<p>These scanners tend to be available only in the major cancer hospitals. So you might have to travel to another hospital to have one. A radiographer operates the scanner. It usually takes between 30 and 60 minutes.</p>

<b>Why you might have it</b>
<p>PET-CT scans can help to show exactly where the cancer is in your lung and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body.</p>

<b>Preparing for your PET-CT scan</b>
<p>For most PET-CT scans, you need to stop eating about 6 hours beforehand. You can usually drink water during this time. You might have instructions not to do any strenuous exercise for 24 hours before the scan.</p>

<p>Call the number on your appointment letter if not eating is a problem for you, for example if you’re diabetic. You might need to adapt your diet and sugar control and your appointment time could change.</p>

<p>Some people feel claustrophobic when they‘re having a scan. Contact the department staff before your test if you’re likely to feel like this. They can take extra care to make sure you’re comfortable and that you understand what’s going on.</p>

<p>Your doctor can arrange to give you medicine to help you relax, if needed.</p>

<b>What happens</b><p>
<b>When you arrive</b></p>
<p>Your radiographer might ask you to change into a hospital gown. You have to remove any jewellery and other metal objects such as hair clips. Metal interferes with the images produced by the scanner.</p>

<p>You have an injection of radioactive liquid called a radiotracer about an hour before the scan. You have this injection through a small plastic tube in your arm (a cannula). It's only a small amount of radiation.</p>

<p>You need to rest and avoid moving too much during this hour. This allows the radiotracer to spread through your body and into your tissues.</p>

<b>In the scanning room</b>
<p>Your radiographer takes you into the scanning room. The PET-CT machine is large and shaped like a doughnut.</p>

<p>You have most scans lying down on the machine couch on your back.</p>

<p>Once you’re in the right position, your radiographer leaves the room. They can see you on a TV screen or through a window from the control room. You can talk to each other through an intercom.</p>

<b>Having the PET-CT scan</b>
<p>The couch slowly slides backwards and forwards through the scanner. The machine takes pictures as you move through it.</p>

<p>The scan is painless but can be uncomfortable because you have to stay still. Tell your radiographer if you’re getting stiff and need to move.</p>

<p>It’s not particularly noisy but you’ll hear a constant background noise.</p>

<p>When it’s over, your radiographer will come back into the room and lower the couch so you can get up.</p>

<h2>Scan Anxiety (Scanxiety)</h2>
<p>The following information is from <a href="https://medivizor.com/blog/2014/06/03/15-tips-cope-scanxiety/">medivizor.com</a></p>
<p>Scanxiety is the term coined for the pre-test and post-test fear that many patients diagnosed with cancer face.</p>
<p>Fear of cancer returning is the underlying source of scanxiety and it is the normal reaction to the life changing experience of a cancer diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Advice from Patients and Healthcare Providers</h2>
<p>Here is some excellent advice from bloggers and healthcare professionals on how to deal with scanxiety.</p>

<b>Before the scan</b>
<ul>
    <li>1) Don’t talk to “problem people” in your life: people who make you feel stressed.</li>
    <li>2) Watch what you read…    </li>
    <li>3) Schedule your scan early in the day…there will be less waiting time.</li>
    <b>Day of Scan</b>
    <li>  4) Bring along a distraction like a movie, book, a game…</li>
    <li>  5) Take a friend with you to your appointment; someone who is calm and can help you laugh.</li>
    <li>  6) Schedule a day and time to discuss the results with your doctor.</li>
<b>To help prevent or reduce scanxiety</b>
    <li> 7) Think about this worry…do you have questions that you have not asked your doctor or healthcare provider? Unanswered questions need to be answered. Write down your questions and do some research to get the answers you need. Believe it or not, having answers reduces scanxiety.</li>
    <li>8) Ground yourself in what is your reality now. Be in the moment. Write down what you ate this morning, evidence of how your children are coping, recent blood work, anything to get you thinking about your life now.</li>
<li>9) Exercise. Exercise is important for combating fatigue and reducing recurrences.</li>
<li>10) Deep breathing slows your churning mind and calms you.
</li>
    <li>11) Challenge the fear thoughts. Some professionals recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to help identify thoughts that are not helpful to you.
    </li>
    <li>12) Medication can help. Your brain is an organ, like your heart. Anxiety or depression may be caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain. Depression, feelings of helplessness or anxiety are not uncommon for people who have experienced a huge life change like a cancer diagnosis.
    </li>

    <li>13) Eat a healthy diet.
    </li>
    <li>14) Be sure to do things for you. Listen to music, take a bubble bath, get a massage, treat yourself. Being kind to yourself helps to reduce anxiety.
    </li>
    <li>15) Talk to a friend, support group or professional. You may be fortunate enough to have a friend with a sympathetic ear who can listen to you. There are support groups both in-person and online with people who have been where you are with scanxiety. One is #BCSM on Twitter. This tweet chat meets on Monday nights at 9pm ET.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>It is reassuring to know that you are not alone. If you do not have access to either of these or if your condition is not improving, seek help from a professional counselor.
