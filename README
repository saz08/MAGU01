To run on a browser, the project must be deployed onto a web server.
The web server used for this project was DEVWEB2018 using this link:
https://devweb2018.cis.strath.ac.uk/~szb15123/Survivors/patient/signUp.php

To deploy onto your own web server, use "Tools" then "Deployment" in IntelliJ and configure for the web server you wish to upload to.
Once all files are uploaded, you can open the project from IntelliJ and will be directed to your browser.
